    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my quest of building out a starting point for my web projects, I researched and tested out quite a bit of the CSS frameworks out there. I was looking for a grid system that would be pretty straightforward for me to pick up and be as universal as possible for responsive and different browsers environments (I&rsquo;m looking at you IE 6-8)</p>

<p>I was first introduced to Sass and have been using it since without looking at Less or Stylus as I really didn&rsquo;t have the need. In my CSS framework testing, I ran into a system that was based on Less that didn&rsquo;t have a Sass alternative so I decided to start to convert it over to Sass to try it out. Unfortunately this wasn&rsquo;t the grid system I was looking for but glad to have this experience if I run into any other Less projects in the future.</p>

<p>Overall the syntax for Less and Sass are pretty similar in some aspects so as long as its not too involved, it should be pretty straightforward to convert over. I&rsquo;m sure there are some converters out there or in the works but think its a good practice to handle this manually. Its a good way to get familiar with the code and see how all of the parts work together with one another.</p>

<p>The obvious first step would be to rename your files with the .less file extension over to .scss or .sass. I personally use the .scss formatting on my Sass files so I&rsquo;ve used that file extension.</p>

<h3>Imports</h3>

<p>Imports will remain the same with using the <code>@import</code> syntax to pull in your various source files.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>This will be the biggest area where you&rsquo;ll more than likely have the most revisions. Less prefixes variables with @ while Sass uses $</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve had tons of ideas over the years but that is mostly all they&rsquo;ve been. Thinking of great ideas of things to design and build are awesome but really doesn&rsquo;t amount to much if you don&rsquo;t actually try to execute them.</p>
