  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve found over the years a typical behaviour that has recently been weighing me down when meeting and estimating out projects for potential new clients.</p>

<p>A company representative reaches out to me to introduce a project and discuss their needs either over the phone or set up a meeting to go over it in person. I spend the time reviewing the project outline, technical specifications, etc. to generate an estimate of what I believe is involved with the information given. I&rsquo;ll review when they can expect to receive the proposal of work and send it via email for their review.</p>

<p>That is when it goes south. There are times when I literally hear nothing back. I never expect an immediate response but after a week of nothing, I&rsquo;ll send a follow up email or place a call to get an idea of where they are with their decision. There have been occasions where that still leads to no response which then gets my mind running on where I fell short.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m baffled with all of this technology available to us today to communicate and I can&rsquo;t even get a simple acknowledgement. I really don&rsquo;t have an issue hearing the word &lsquo;No&rsquo; or telling me I&rsquo;m an asshole or I&rsquo;m crazy to think that their project would cost that much.</p>

<p>Any additional feedback would be great as to why I wasn&rsquo;t selected but honestly I&rsquo;d love to just hear that it was received. It is all bonus points if there is a thank you for putting this together, we&rsquo;ve found someone else, or we aren&rsquo;t ready to make a decision, etc.</p>

<p>Maybe the issue is how I present the estimate to clients. I&rsquo;ve been thinking maybe it involves setting up a meeting to review the proposal in person. It then presents the opportunity to ensure all of the main functions are covered along with being able to answer any questions as it&rsquo;s presented. I&rsquo;m not sure if budget and the size of the project come into play as to whether meeting would be too much for what is involved.</p>

<p>As I write this, I&rsquo;m reflecting on how I&rsquo;ve dealt with other companies where I&rsquo;ve needed estimates to put things into perspective. I was recently looking into have our roof reshingled and reached out to four different roofing companies for estimates. Three of those four companies actually came out to measure our roof and take down some information on our home. Within about a week I had been emailed all of the estimates breaking down their costs and time involved. After reviewing each, I emailed the ones we didn&rsquo;t select to simply thank them for their time and let them know we had selected another company to take on our project. It literally took a few minutes and I&rsquo;m sure they appreciated the acknowledgment. One company actually replied to say thank you for the response and offered any help if we ever had any future roof work.</p>

<p>The next time you are looking to get an estimate from a company, think about giving them a quick response to let them know it was received. Is it a necessity? No, but I think it is just a common courtesy to acknowledge that they took the time to present this information for you to make a decision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Or what I&rsquo;ve learned while teaching an introduction to HTML and CSS class.</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m on my fifth year now teaching an intro to website development at a local college and am always looking for new ways to teach the material. I initially started out teaching the course online. The class was structured with students reading the assigned book and completing their assignments while I served as a mediator to help answer questions and guide them along the way.</p>

<p>Starting last spring, I&rsquo;m now teaching the course in the classroom which allows me to demostrate coding, have the students work hands-on and most importantly, get to know the students to determine their strengths and weaknesses. I&rsquo;ve currently started my third semester of this course and I encounter new issues every time that really shows how differently people look at coding for the first time.</p>
